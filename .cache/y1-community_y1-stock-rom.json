"name": "System Software Update 2.8.2", "body": "Video Fix: Resolved an issue that prevented videos from being paused reliably.\r\n\r\nVideo Stability: Improved handling of video playback to prevent the application from crashing (fixing IllegalStateException on startup).\r\n\r\nVideo Management: Enhanced logic for checking video folders to ensure that non-folder files are skipped.\r\n\r\nMultilingual Support:\r\n\r\nUser Interface (UI):\r\n\r\nImplemented a scrolling marquee effect for file names that are too long to fit on the screen.\r\n\r\nFixed several bugs related to the Theme interface.\r\n\r\nFile Management:\r\n\r\nImproved folder deletion logic to ensure all checks for video files are completed.\r\n\r\nChanged file name sorting to be case-insensitive (treating \"A\" and \"a\" the same).\r\n\r\nMusic & Video Sync:\r\n\r\nFixed a bug where the music database was not synchronized when video folders were deleted.\r\n\r\nCrucial Fix: Ensured that music playback is completely stopped when a video starts playing.\r\n\r\nDatabase: Database version updated from 3 to 4.\r\n\r\nKey Lock: Modified the Key Lock implementation to ensure it persists correctly after a restart.\r\n\r\nVideo Thumbnails: Reduced the number of concurrent processes for generating video thumbnails to prevent conflicts and improve stability.\r\n\r\nVideo Thumbnails: Optimized thumbnail generation logic, now saving thumbnails as files for better performance.\r\n\r\nVideo Error Handling: Adjusted video error detection (error code -38 is no longer treated as a playback failure).\r\n\r\nSearch/Multi-select: Fixed an issue where the multi-select status and search results were not cleared after adding items to a playlist.\r\n\r\nLocalization: Corrected German and French translations.\r\n\r\nPlayback List: Fixed issues where default playback list names were not set according to the device's primary language after a factory reset.\r\n\r\nTheming/Customization: Fixed bugs related to theme deletion and ensuring the default wallpaper is restored correctly.\r\n\r\nTheme Installation: Default themes are now copied in the background to prevent copying from stopping if the screen turns off.\r\n\r\n# You can install Y1 this update from Innioasis Updater, using SP Flash Tool, or MTK Client with the correct drivers for your system.\r\n\r\n# Simply head to www.innioasis.com/pages/download for driver, utility and update instructions for your device.\r\n", "published_at": "2025-10-28T18:47:56Z", "download_url":
